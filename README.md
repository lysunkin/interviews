# interviews
tasks implemented for my coding interviews

Written to memorize tasks from different coding interviews I had in Jan 2019.
Some of them were implemented right on the interview, some of them were "take home" exercises

TODO:
1) Implement task for finding N-th smallest element in array
2) Serialization of complex JSON object with the retrieval of commited version in minimal time
3) Finding element in a binary tree
4) Dijkstra (or more optimal) traversal of graph for finding the shortest path
5) Calculation of maximum sum of a window into an array
